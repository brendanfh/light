ROBOT PROGRAMMING AND VISUALS

Create custom programming language that instructions robots to move around a grid and perform tasks.
Visualize this system with OpenGL 3.0 ES

Language may look something like this:

$A = 10
:LOOP_TOP
	IF $A ~= 0 THEN
		$A = $A - 1
		GOTO :LOOP_TOP
	END

This is compiled to a bytecode, which is executed by the program.
Language is compiled at runtime, then bytecode is used.
